# VidStr - Video Streaming Platform

This is a video streaming platform built with React and Vite, providing a modern and efficient development environment with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and ESLint integration.

## Tech Stack

The application uses the following core technologies:

- React 18 for the frontend UI
- Vite as the build tool and development server
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Redux Toolkit for state management
- React Router for navigation

## Development Setup

To get started with development:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the development server with `npm run dev`

The development server includes:
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- ESLint configuration for code quality
- TypeScript integration for better development experience

## Production Build

For production deployment:

1. Run `npm run build` to create an optimized build
2. The built files will be in the `dist` directory
3. Deploy the contents of `dist` to your hosting platform

## Code Quality

This project uses ESLint with TypeScript integration for maintaining code quality. The configuration includes:
- Type-aware lint rules
- React-specific best practices
- Modern JavaScript features support

For additional TypeScript configuration and ESLint rules, refer to the `tsconfig.json` and `.eslintrc.js` files in the project root.
